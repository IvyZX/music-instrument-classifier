This is a simple classifier that is able to detect single-node sounds of various musical instruments.

Currently supported types are cello, clarinet, flute and violin. Piano will be supported soon. 

All the data used are collected from London Philharmonic Orchestra Dataset (http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/explore/sound_samples). Original audio files not included in this repository.
